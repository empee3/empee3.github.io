    desc="The agency that I worked with at the time was looking for a best-fit project management system that would allow account managers to efficiently enter tasks, but allow those tasks to be assigned later during our daily meetings. We decided to build our own system in Drupal 7 that would include a task management system, filtering, and a Kanban board. In addition to the UI, I also setup the Views and queries and Drupal to build all of the system's functionality."
